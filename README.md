# Scripts and useful commands

A collection of scripts and useful commands, very much a WIP.

## ovpn.sh
Connect to HTB/THM network, through OVPN with supplied profile.

## ufw-box-rule.sh
Used for ufw firewall rule on HTB/THM network, for connecting to boxes.

## practice-exams.py
Adds files for going through [Professor Messer's](https://www.professormesser.com/) practice exams.

## snippets-python.json
Collection of Python snippets, used in VS Code.

## tun0-mtu
Fixes problem with OVPN, for me on HTB (shell uploads). Makes MTU changes permanent (put in `/etc/network/if-up.d/tun0-mtu`, make executable with `chmod a+x /etc/network/if-up.d/tun0-mtu`). Requires more testing.

## useful-commands.md
Collection of some useful commands, mainly focusing on CTFs/other engagements.

This project is on [GitHub](https://github.com/JulianFechner/scripts-useful-commands).
